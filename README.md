# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classifier using KNN

## Objective
This project aims to create a classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to diagnose breast cancer as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database.
Explore: to visualize the different predicition scores with different test splits
Select: to choose the best model or optimal train-test split with best performance

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database. It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding and application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Results
A summary of the model's performance and accuracy in classifying breast cancer.
